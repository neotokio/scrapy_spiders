# Scrapy Spiders Examples

Repositories with Scrapy made web crawlers.

<b>What's inside?</b>

Scrapers use different approach.

Scraping HTML rendered content using absolute paths

Scraping HTML rendered content using relative paths (xpath logic selection)

Scraping JavaScript rendered content using Scrapy-Splash

Scraping content from local file

Additional scripts for processing data (Extracting URLS from local HTML File, processing URLS from JSON API)

JSON pipelines

<b>Usability</b>

All code was written for specific use-case, therefore it's most likley unusable for you. For example, sometimes we supply long URL list extracted from JSON API before. You should use this repositories mostly as reference when stuck on writing your *scrapy logic/xpath logic* or when you simply look for some alternative approach
